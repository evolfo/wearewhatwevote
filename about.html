			<h3>About us</h3>
			<p><span class="weareblue">We Are What We Vote</span> is a project by real people for real people. We’re a bunch of artists who think it’s vitally important for everyone who can to take part in our democracy, and that voting should be as easy as ordering coffee. So we made it simple.</p>
			<p>We asked some folks why voting is important to them and made these videos for you to share wherever and however you like (don’t forget to hashtag <span class="weareblue">#WeAreWhatWeVote</span>). Then we made some killer posters that make registering super easy (just scan the QR code!). Go ahead and download a few to put up at your local café, park, home, grocery store, or anywhere else. While you’re at it, feel free to share your story about why <span class="weareblue">#WeAreWhatWeVote</span>.</p>
